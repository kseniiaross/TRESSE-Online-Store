        question: "Do I need an account to place an order?",
        answer:
          "Yes. An account is required to place an order. You can browse products and add items to your cart without an account, but you’ll need to sign in or create one to complete your purchase. This helps us securely process payments, manage orders, and provide order history and support.",

        category: "Shipping",
        question: "How long does delivery take?",
        answer:
          "Delivery time depends on your country and shipping method. After dispatch, standard delivery typically takes 3–10 business days, and express delivery is usually faster.",
      },
      {
        id: "ship-3",
        category: "Shipping",
        question: "Will I pay duties or customs fees?",

        category: "Shipping",
        question: "My package says delivered, but I don’t have it. What now?",

      },
      {
        id: "ret-3",
        category: "Returns",
        question: "When will I get my refund?",
        answer:
          "Refunds are processed after we receive and inspect the return. Depending on your bank, it may take 3–10 business days to appear on your statement.",
      },
      {
        id: "ret-4",
        category: "Returns",
        question: "Can I exchange an item?",
        answer:
          "If you need a different size or color, the fastest option is usually to return the original item and place a new order. If your piece is limited, contact support first.",
      },

      // PRODUCT
      {
        id: "prod-1",
        category: "Product",
        question: "Are your items handmade?",

      },
      {
        id: "prod-2",
        category: "Product",
        question: "How do I choose the right size?",
        answer:
          "Use the Size Guide for measurements and fit notes. If you’re between sizes, choose based on your preferred fit (closer or more relaxed).",
      },
      {
        id: "prod-3",
        category: "Product",
        question: "Will an item restock?",
        answer:

        question: "How should I wash knitwear?",
        answer:

      },
      {
        id: "care-2",
        category: "Care",
        question: "How do I prevent pilling?",
        answer:
          "Pilling can happen naturally with knitwear. To reduce it, avoid friction (bags, rough coats) and use a fabric comb or sweater shaver gently when needed.",
      },
      {
        id: "care-3",
        category: "Care",
        question: "How should I store knitwear?",
        answer:
          "Fold and store flat to keep the shape. Hanging knitwear can stretch it over time, especially with heavier pieces.",
      },

      // PAYMENTS
      {
        id: "pay-1",
        category: "Payments",
        question: "What payment methods do you accept?",

      },
      {
        id: "pay-2",
        category: "Payments",
        question: "Is my payment information secure?",
