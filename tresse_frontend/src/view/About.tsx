          TRESSE began quietly as a personal hobby, not a business plan.
          It started with yarn, needles, and long evenings spent learning how
          patience turns into form.
        </p>

        <p>
          What began as simple handmade pieces for friends slowly grew into
          something more intentional. Each garment carried time, attention,
          and the unmistakable character of human hands.
        </p>

        <p>
          We believe knitwear should feel personal. Not rushed. Not mass-produced.
          Every piece is created in small quantities, designed to last beyond
          seasons and trends.
        </p>

        <p>
          TRESSE is not about fast fashion. It’s about choosing quality,
          slowing down, and wearing something made with care from the first
          stitch to the final detail.
